= Introduction =

Enable using flash memory or solid state drive(SSD) as innodb's secondary buffer pool.<br>
This feature is much like flash cache in Oracle's Extradata

After enable this feature, when the page was removed from the innodb buffer pool, InnoDB will move it to the flash memory or ssd storage. When InnoDB read a new page which is not in the buffer pool, it will read the secondary buffer pool. If the page is cached in secondary buffer pool, it will not read the disk. Because the high random read performance of flash memory or ssd, this will boost the database performance. From my test, even using a very normal flash memory, InnoDB's performance is 2x - 3x faster .

= Configuration =

1. create the file on flash memory, we use this file as secondary buffer pool<br>

dd if=/dev/zero of=/db/ib_sbpfile bs=16384 count=655360

2. edit the my.cnf file, add followings:

{{{
[mysqld]
innodb-secondary-buffer-pool-size=10G
innodb-secondary-buffer-pool-file=/db/ib_sbpfile
}}}


3. watch secondary buffer pool status using show innodb status\G:

4. new innodb status variables:
