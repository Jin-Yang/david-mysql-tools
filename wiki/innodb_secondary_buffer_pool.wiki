#labels InnoDB,SSD,Flash,Cache
= Introduction =

Enable using flash memory or solid state drive(SSD) as innodb's secondary buffer pool.<br>
This feature is much like flash cache in Oracle's Exadata

After enable this feature, when the page was removed from the innodb buffer pool, InnoDB will move it to the flash memory or ssd storage. When InnoDB read a new page which is not in the buffer pool, it will read the secondary buffer pool first. If the page is cached in secondary buffer pool, it will not read the disk. Because the high random read performance of flash memory or ssd, this will boost the database performance.

For using innodb secondary buffer pool, it is highly recommand you using 64 bit os system.

= Configuration =

1. create the file on flash memory, we use this file as secondary buffer pool

dd if=/dev/zero of=ib_sbpfile bs=16384 count=655360 

2. edit the my.cnf file, add followings:

{{{
[mysqld]
innodb-secondary-buffer-pool-size=10G
innodb-secondary-buffer-pool-file=/db/ib_sbpfile
}}}


3. watch secondary buffer pool status using show innodb status\G:
{{{
mysql> show engine innodb status\G;
*************************** 1. row ***************************
......
----------------------
SECONDARY BUFFER POOL
----------------------
Secondary buffer pool size      65536
Free pages      0
LRU pages       65536
Pages read 3659084, sync 1166095, swap 52053
Secondary buffer pool hit rate 969 / 1000
......
}}}
4. new innodb status variables:
{{{
mysql> show status like 'innodb_sec%';
+------------------------------------+---------+
| Variable_name                      | Value   |
+------------------------------------+---------+
| Innodb_secondary_buffer_pool_reads | 3694769 |
| Innodb_secondary_buffer_pool_sync  | 1177590 |
| Innodb_secondary_buffer_pool_swap  | 52165   |
+------------------------------------+---------+
3 rows in set (0.01 sec)
}}}

= Next New Feature =
 # allow to pin the table into secondary buffer pool.
 # add LRU aglorithm to secondary buffer pool.
 # add secondary buffer pool status info to INFORMATION_SCHEMA.
